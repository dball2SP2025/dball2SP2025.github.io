## My Interests
* **Family** - I have a beautiful wife and two daughters currently in college, with whom I enjoy spending time outdoors and going to the theater at DPAC.
* **Outdoors** - I love getting outside for hiking, backpacking, or camping whenever possible.
* **Investing** - When I'm not outdoors, I enjoy working on websites, investing in cryptocurrency and domain names.
* **Learning** - I enjoy learning about _all kinds of things_, from work or school related things to just about anything that sounds interesting.
